# rehype-color-chips

[rehype] plugin to add a color chip with an inline code block containing a [supported color model].

Some examples: `#fa3467` `#ef3` `rgb(24, 213, 78)` `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`

Note that the 3-digit hex code doesn't work on GitHub, but works with this plugin.

Works with [next-mdx-remote].

Appropriate [styles](#styling) will need to be applied for the the color "chip" to show up.
